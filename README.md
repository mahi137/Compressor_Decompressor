# Compressor_Decompressor
@ Author SHAIK MOHID
## Introduction

Objective of this project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique. This project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression. Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs. Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing. In this project, we will ensure that our compressed files can be decompressed or restored to their original form.The emphasis on lossless compression techniques guarantees that no data is lost during the compression process, safeguarding the integrity of the compressed data.
